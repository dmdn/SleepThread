# Description
This app was made as a training.

## Technical task
Write a program in Java that runs 10 threads in parallel. Each thread runs a process that randomly assigns an id. The process executes a 
line output in a loop: "beep" + id + i, where i is the iteration step (10 steps in total). After each output, the process 
"falls asleep" for a while, which is determined by random.
